Askar Maintainers:

Please review the following [technical charter draft for Askar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18605BFnPQIhOz0OSSdPIQKP2JfP-pcse5Tir0S8CZIw/edit?tab=t.0)

Anywhere you would like to make a change, please add a comment **in the google doc linked above**.

Once the maintainers provide comments and approve, LF Project Formation will finalize the document. We can then update GOVERNANCE.md with the PDF of the charter. 

Per the Linux Foundation, 

*A technical charter is created for all new projects to define both the project operations and the IP policy.  
We have proposed technical oversight for the project that falls to a “Technical Steering Committee” made up of the project’s committers. 
At a later date the TSC is free to evolve how membership on the TSC is determined to accommodate project growth and the evolution of its governance.*
